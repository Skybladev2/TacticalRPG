Grid Mapping for unity is a in editor tool for unity that assists you in the creation of worlds that are based around a grid. 

NOTE: The current version of this tool does not contain a grid or tile mapping/management system. It is a in-editor 
creation tool only. Version 2 introduces some preliminary editor & runtime management API's via C# extension methods.	  								   

Some screen shots use tile sets from Ari Feldman's SpriteLib (Common Public License) and are not included with this package.
